# weather-forecast-api

## Description
This app functions so that you can search any location and it will bring up the weather for the week. It retrieves this data via fetch from the OpenWeather API and is formatted using Bootstrap/HTML/CSS/JS. I gained a lot of knowledge on creating functions in Javascript and navigating API data during this project and I felt things "click" while doing it. I had fun too! 

## Usage
Simply open the live page at [https://jaolsen7.github.io/weather-forecast-api/](https://jaolsen7.github.io/weather-forecast-api/) and type in a city/click search!

## Credits
Huge credit goes to my professor (John) who held extended office hours in order to help us.

## Improvements
In future projects, I would reorganize my code so that it creates two divs containers: current and forecast. Currently it just adds to the same div, which looks bad when you search multiple items. This would require some reorganization of both my html and JS code.
