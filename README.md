# weather-forecast-api

## Description
This app functions so that you can search any location and it will bring up the weather for the week. It retrieves this data via fetch from a weather API and is formatted using Bootstrap/HTML/CSS/JS. I gained a lot of knowledge on creating functions in Javascript and navigating API data during this project and I felt things "click" while doing it. I had fun too!

## Usage
Simply open the HTML and type in your search!
